# Enforce Villager Trade Selection
===========

There are some cases in which the trading with villagers does not properly work if the player does not explicitly select the target trade in the villager's trade list. This Bukkit plugin prevents players from inserting items directly into the input slots of the villager trading interface, and instead requires them to explicitly select the target trade in the trade list.

Supported Bukkit versions: 1.16.5 and above.

## Permissions

`enforceVillagerTradeSelection.bypass`: Bypasses the restriction of having to explicitly select villager trades.
